# PyramidTraverseExercise

The purpose of this exercise is to find the highest possible sum when traversing through the matrix.

The exercise is based on the following premises:
- the matrix is of a pyramid structure.
- you start from the top and traverse down to the last child.
- when traversing down through the pyramid, you can only choose between the left or the right child element beneath you.
- when traversing down through the pyramid, you have to change between odd and even numbers - such as: odd > even > odd > even.
- there is always a valid path down through the pyramid.
